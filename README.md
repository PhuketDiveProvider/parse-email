## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migrations

### Adding Missing Columns

If you encounter errors related to missing columns, run the following SQL in your Neon SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add national_park_fee column for National Park Fee feature
ALTER TABLE bookings
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS national_park_fee BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Add google_analytics_id column for Google Analytics tracking
ALTER TABLE settings 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS google_analytics_id TEXT;
```

### Schema Compatibility

The application automatically handles missing columns and provides user-friendly error messages when features are not available in your database schema. This ensures compatibility across different deployments with varying database configurations.
