## [Unreleased]
- Role-based access control is now fully implemented:

  - Accounting: Access Dashboard, Bookings, and Accounting tabs. Cannot delete bookings or edit/remove programs. No access to settings or whitelist.
  - Programs Manager: Only access to Programs tab (can add/edit programs, but cannot delete unless Admin).
  - Reservation: Only access to Bookings tab.
- Backend and frontend both enforce these permissions. UI hides tabs and actions not allowed for the current role.
